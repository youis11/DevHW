Let’s test our C++ skills: Create a new vec3 class with
- Contains three values x,y,z with templatized type
- Think of at least three handy constructors
- Operators +, -, +=, -=, =, ==
- Methods: normalize(), zero(), is_zero(), distance_to(vec3 …)
- Mind references and const!
Upload it to your github and will be reviewed next class.
